## REFERRALS

- NEUROLOGIST: The patient's episodes of "freezing up", confusion, and difficulty forming sentences could be indicative of a neurological condition such as transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), seizures, or a form of dementia. The neurologist should conduct a thorough neurological examination, including cognitive and motor function assessments. The neurologist should also review the patient's medication for cholesterol to assess if it could be contributing to these episodes.

## LABS & TESTS

- EEG (ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM): This test will help to identify any abnormal electrical activity in the brain that could be indicative of seizures. The patient's episodes of "freezing up" and subsequent confusion could be due to a form of epilepsy that is not accompanied by the typical physical sensations.

- MRI OF THE BRAIN: This imaging test will help to identify any structural abnormalities in the brain, such as tumors, that could be causing the patient's symptoms. It can also help to rule out conditions such as stroke or other forms of brain damage.

- COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT (CBC): This test will help to identify any underlying conditions that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms, such as anemia or infection.

- SLEEP STUDY: Given the patient's report of an increase in frequency of episodes when they have had less sleep, a sleep study could help to identify any sleep disorders that could be contributing to these episodes.
